export const INTRO_CONTENT = "The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have presented unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human languages. The success of LLMs/FMs has also resulted in many new research directions in the AI and machine learning community. One major direction is the integration of LLMs with spatio-temporal data. LLMs can provide strong semantic reasoning to enhance the analysis of spatio-temporal data. By combining LLMs with spatio-temporal analysis, we can unlock new insights and develop more robust models for applications ranging from smart city applications and climate science to mobility simulation for epidemiology. Enabling LLMs to better understand the patterns in spatio-temporal data from various and ubiquitous sensors (such as IoT devices, healthcare, wearable devices, and smart vehicles) is also a crucial step towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence.\n\n" +
    // "Our workshop will focus on the challenges and opportunities presented by the intersection of LLMs and complex temporal and spatiotemporal datasets. We aim to shape this workshop as a platform for researchers, practitioners, students, and related stakeholders to share the latest findings, discuss novel methodologies, and explore collaborative opportunities. With a focus on time-series and spatiotemporal data, the workshop will address the unique aspects of these types of data and how LLMs can be leveraged to extract meaningful contextual insights.\n\n" +
    // "This workshop is a direct response to the growing interests in leveraging LLMs for analysis time-series and spatiotemporal data. Our workshop seeks to identify the unique challenges and opportunities such as how to design a better prompt or tokenization process for temporal data to leverage LLMs and what the optimal network architectures for spatiotemporal foundation models. To achieve the objective, this workshop encourages submissions of innovative solutions and visions for time-series and spatiotemporal data using foundation models or LLMs-related techniques. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following: \n\n" +
    "• Spatio-temporal data forecasting using LLMs and FMs \n" +
    "• Spatio-temporal data simulation using LLMs and FMs \n" +
    "• FMs/LLMs for spatio-temporal representation learning  \n" +
    "• FMs/LLMs for trajectory, transportation, urban, climate, and social applications \n" +
    "• Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques for spatio-temporal data \n" +
    "• Privacy and security for spatio-temporal LLMs/FMs \n" +
    "• Large-scale spatio-temporal datasets for pre-training LLMs/FMs \n" +
    "• Prompt mining and engineering for spatio-temporal data \n" +
    "• Benchmarking LLMs/FMs for spatio-temporal data \n" +
